> Software should make the job easier, not harder.

I code with the phrase above at the forefront of my mind. As a developer I only have to write it once, but the user has to use what I write over and over. It may be harder for me to write it, but if what I write makes lives easier it's worth it. I enjoy using open source products and always enjoy when I can give back the community.

In my professional life I'm a software developer and in my personal life, I love to get away and build something with my hands or take the boat out. On the occassions when I develop on my personal time, it's something that is very useful to me and I'll take the time because I know it will make my life easier. Whether it's an inventory program for my garage or a Docker Compose file, I try to work on everything with the same phrase in mind.
