> Software should make the world a better place.

As you can see my repos range from Docker images to APIs with an Arduino repo thrown in for good measure. My job is development, and typically when I leave work I don't spend a lot of time in front of the computer. But when I do I typically have a good reason. I code with the phrase above at the forefront of my mind. As a developer, I only have to write it once, but the user has to use what I write over and over. It may be harder for me to write it, but if what I write makes lives easier it's worth it. I enjoy using open source products and on occasion I will see the need to fork, tweak and issue a PR. I am by no means an expert, I just have very high expectations.
